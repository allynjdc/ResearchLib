The effectiveness of the H5P interactive intervention in teaching mathematics was investigated using a quasi-experimental design employing a purposive sampling in Grade 7 students. The experimental group used the intervention while the control group used the digital modules in the learning management system. The data were collected using an online synchronous timed pretest and posttest. The data were tabulated, presented, evaluated, and interpreted. The findings revealed that students had an average mastery level in the pretest, which leveled up to moving towards mastery in the posttest. When the mean difference of the pretest and posttest of the experimental group was tested, it was found out that the computed p-value of 0.0065 was lower than the 0.05 level of significance; thus, the intervention was successful. From the findings, it is suggested that utilization of H5P interactive learning material through learning management systems in teaching mathematics be continued by the learners, intensified through additional training of teachers, and maximized through adoption by online class teachers.', '2022-04-28', 'Tagum City National High School', ' H5P intervention, teaching mathematics, learning management system, experimental', 10, '2-6', 'H5P - Cuamag.pdf', '../resources/research/H5P - Cuamag.pdf'),

A quasi-experimental study of two Grade 11 sections was conducted on functions and rational functions during a lesson. The respondents were selected through purposive sampling. The study was conducted during the first quarter of the first semester of 2021-2022. The study implemented three phases: pre-experimentation, experimentation, and post experimentation. A pre-test was given to both groups. Group A (control group) received modular instruction, while Group B (experimental group) received the treatment using Google Classroom. Afterward, a post-test was given to both groups. The data gathered were tabulated, computed, and analyzed using appropriate statistical tools, such as Mean, T-test, and ANCOVA. The pre-test results indicated that the control group had the edge over the experimental group at the start of the experiment. Results in the post-test demonstrated that the two groups performed well equally in Mathematics. However, comparing the mean gain scores between the two groups revealed that the experimental group was higher than the control group. This pointed out that using Google Classroom as a learning platform in teaching Mathematics was better than the modular way of teaching.

This mixed methods study aimed to determine and describe the lived experiences of senior high school learners in terms of the role of technology in 21st century education. The researcher collected data from 100 senior high school (SHS) learners using simple random sampling for the quantitative phase (QTP) and five from SHS students using purposive sampling for the qualitative phase (QLP) for SY 2021-2022. Survey questionnaires and an in-depth interview guide were utilized to gather data and were analyzed using frequency, percentage, mean, and thematic analysis. Results revealed that because of the widespread availability of internet mobile connections, there has been a significant number of students that use technology. As a result, students have a high level of computer skills and use of technology because it is useful and relevant in the educational process. Similarly, students see the value of incorporating technology into classroom discussions since it increases their interest in the subject. Furthermore, technology is viewed as an important tool for learning, and the importance of using social media is proved by learners\' average daily usage. The introduction of popular media into the lives of students has had a significant impact on this. Despite the negative effects of social media, students still find it useful in the classroom since it can spark other people\'s interests and inspire them to learn.

This study examined the effective use of the Topic, Inference, Proof, Sum-up (TIPS) strategy in developing reading comprehension in science among learners. The investigation was conducted using a quasi-experimental design in School A of Tagum City Division, Davao del Norte. The 70 Grade 7 students who participated were chosen through a purposive sampling technique. The data were collected using synchronous online timed pretest and posttest, and the results were then tabulated and textually presented, analyzed, and interpreted. The findings reveal that no significant difference between the experimental group\'s pretest and posttest has a p-value of 0.13, which is larger than the 0.05 level for significance (p > 0.05). The null hypothesis is therefore not refuted. This indicates that there is no significant difference between the experimental group\'s pretest and post-test scores when the TIPS strategy is used. Students have below-average reading comprehension, lack skills, abilities, struggle to utilize the TIPS strategy and have the same competency level before and after the intervention.
